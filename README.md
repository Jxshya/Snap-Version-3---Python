This coding prohect was also made back in late 2023, but not for my College Project, just out of my own pure boredom.

The reason why it is named "Snap3" is because I made 2 previous codes for Snap and they all work perfectly fine, however, Snap3 just made the most sense to work as a real game - if you know what I mean.
It gives you a lot of options to pick from the card, deck and shuffling capabilities. - Oh and the gameplay of this game is auto, so just sit back and let the code do its work - but you can change it as well.
